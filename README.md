# Autocode-App
The unofficial App for https://autocode.com developed personally by myself.

**NOTICE**

This app is neither made or supported by [Autocode](https://autocode.com). Unlike others who can ban you against using such unofficial softwares Autocode _might_ not ban you but you are still advised to maintain security. I advise that you sign up using the official website and then log-in with the app. I also do not recommend purchasing items using the app as that section is untested and maybe risky. Incase you do purchase items using the app and do not receive it within 3 days, no refund will be done and I will not be responsible for the lose. NEITHER AUTOCODE OR MYSELF WILL BE REPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSSES. 



NO DATA WILL BE STOLEN. INCASE YOU SUSPECT THAT YOU'RE DATA HAS BEEN STOLEN UNINSTALL THE APP AND REPORT IT TO ME AT ```aeolusdeveloper@gmail.com```.


After starting up the app it _will_ show a page showing error. Press the Autocode Logo on the top left to enter the home page and then you're all ready to log into your account!


DO NOT VISIT THE SOCIAL MEDIA SITES ON THE APP AS THEN YOU'LL NEED TO RESTART THE APP TO GO TO YOUR HOMEPAGE. I'LL TRY AND FIX THIS ISSUE LATER IN TIME
